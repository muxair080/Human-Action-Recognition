# Human-Action-Recognition
I built a project for recognizing human actions using ConvLSTM and LRCN models, trained on a dataset from Kaggle with 50 action classes. Due to limited resources, I trained the model on only 5 classes. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/ucf50-action-recognition-dataset.
